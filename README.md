# Udacity-Cloud-Devops-Engineer-Nanodegree-Capstone

In this project I will apply the skills and knowledge which were developed throughout the Cloud DevOps Nanodegree program. These include:

* Working in AWS
* Using Jenkins or Circle CI to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
* Building pipelines
* Working with Ansible and CloudFormation to deploy clusters
* Building Kubernetes clusters
* Building Docker containers in pipelines

I will develop a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins for a simple micro service application written in Node.js and take theblue/green deployment strategy. I will also develop further Continuous Integration steps as typographical checking (aka “linting”) to mimic real-world development as much as possible. To make my project stand out, I may also choose to implement other checks such as security scanning, performance testing, smoke testing and promoting the new version of the app.

## Complete Steps

1. For the Docker application the directions are rather more open-ended. I can choose an application and decided to build a sample app in [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs) which is a simple web server returning a "Hello World" message.
2. For this project, I decided to use CircleCI as a CI server. Since I wanted to avoid any on-premise solutions, I decided to not use it locally but use the cloud-hosted solution.
